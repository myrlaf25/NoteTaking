# NoteTaking

## Description

My objective with this project is to create an application that can be used to write and save notes.
This was built in order to make note taking easier and to allow the user to refer back to any old notes, create new notes, or delete them. 
This application uses Express.js for the back end and saves and retrieves notes from a JSON file. The applications front end code was provided by Trilogy. My task was to build the back end, connect both, and deploy the app to Heroku.
